hammurabi is an open-source (GNU General Public License v3) package
for simulating full/partial-sky Galactic emissions.
The outputs of (current version) hammurabi X include:

- **polarized synchrotron emission**
- **dispersion measure** 
- **Faraday depth**

Essential physical inputs/modelings required during simulation include:  

- **Galactic magnetic field**
- **(cosmic-ray & thermal) electron distribution**

hammurabi X is a modular C++ framework which is friendly to user defined models.
Based on earlier versions of hammurabi, we mainly focus on improving its numerical reliablility and scalability.

Please check our [**WIKI**](https://github.com/hammurabi-dev/hammurabiX/wiki) for more detailed technical information.

The original [**hammurabi v3**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hammurabicode/) is still accessible.
